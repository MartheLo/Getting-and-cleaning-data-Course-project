# Getting-and-cleaning-data-Course-project

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

1. Loads and merges the train and test datasets
2. Extracts the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
3. Adds descriptive activity names
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names
5. Creates a second, tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

The end result is shown in the file tidy.txt.
